## ü§ì IS216 - Group 28 - DogPals &#128021;
The team comprises of 5 web developers:

* DARIEN TAN SHI FENG (darien.tan.2020@scis.smu.edu.sg)
  üê∂ Darien has always wanted a dog and is considering to get one when he lives alone. 
* HAZEL MA RUIQI (hazelma.2020@scis.smu.edu.sg) 
  üê∂ Hazel had a maltese called Snowball. She enjoyed playing with him and bringing him out to explore!
* JOEY LAU RUN-QI (joeylau.2020@scis.smu.edu.sg)
  üê∂ Joey visits pet cafes in her free time. Albeit afraid of large dogs, she finds small furry dogs really adorable and easy to befriend!
* SHAMBHAVI GOENKA (shambhavig.2019@scis.smu.edu.sg)
  üê∂ Shambhavi feeds the street dogs every now and then and always carries some food while travelling so as to feed other street dogs spotted.
* TAN TING CHER BENJAMIN (benjamintan.2020@scis.smu.edu.sg)
  üê∂ Benjamin had 2 dogs, phoebe and fatty whilst living in Thailand.

As seen above, all 5 of us have experience interacting with dogs and a soft spot to care for their needs, and this led us to the birth of DogPals! üêï


## ü§ì Project Overview ##
We started this web application called DogPals with the aim of providing a platform for dog owners to find playmates for their pet. Other functionalities include allowing users to chat with other dog owners and arranging for a playdate between them and their dogs as well as showcasing pet-friendly places with high ratings and good reviews to recommend dog owners to visit with their dog. ü•∞

We noticed that there is a rising trend of dog adoption and fostering in Singapore amid the COVID-19 pandemic but it has also come to our attention that dog loneliness can stem from being left alone at home when their owners head out to work. Just like all of us, dogs have emotions and do crave for companionship. As a group of dog-loving individuals, we decided to use DogPals to help these dogs verbalise their needs for socialisation and address this pain point. ü§ç

Dogpals is targeting dog owners of all ages and gender in Singapore who are looking to find playmates for their dogs or exploring pet-friendly places to bring their dogs to. These owners can either view our website on a Macbook Pro, 13.3 inch with screen dimensions (1440 x 900) or on iphone X, 5.85 inch with screen demensions (375 x 812) for optimal results. üíª üì±

## ü§ì How to Use Our Web Application (for Visitors to our Website) ##

**Upon visiting our website, the user will be brought to the homepage. If the user is a new visitor, he can sign up for an account with us by clicking on the 'SIGN UP' button. If the user already has an account, he can simply click on the 'LOGIN' button.**

![Homepage](images/readme/homepage.png) 


**At the sign up page, the user is required to fill in their email, create a username and password! In order to proceed, the user has to check on the reCAPTCHA checkbox.**

![Sign Up](images/readme/signup.png) 


**On the other hand, the login page requires the user to enter their username and password to verify their credentials.**

![Login](images/readme/login.png) 


**After the account registration, it will then bring the user to the profile set up which requires him to perform a series of steps to fill in information about both him and his dog.**

**Step 1: User's personal information**

![Profile Setup 1](images/readme/profile_setup1.png) 


**Step 2: User's dog information**

![Profile Setup 2](images/readme/profile_setup2.png) 


**Step 3: More information about the user's dog so that other dog owners will know if the dog is a right match for them**

![Profile Setup 3](images/readme/profile_setup3.png) 


**Step 4: View summary of both profiles and if there are no changes to be made, the user can proceed to click 'SUBMIT'.**

![Profile Setup 4](images/readme/profile_setup4.png) 

*We are making an assumption here that most dog owners only have ONE dog. Therefore, we only allow users to fill in ONE dog profile.*


**The user is now login to her account and can see a 'Chat' tab added to her navigation bar. The 'Chat' tab is not visible to users who did not register an account with DogPals.**

![Homepage when user is login](images/readme/homepage_for_user_login.png) 


**The user can click on the 'Find a Playmate' tab to view profiles of other dogs. She can make use of the search and filter bar to help narrow down the search of a particular dog. If any playmate catches the user's eye, the user can click on 'READ MORE' to view a more comprehensive profile of the playmate. Users who do not have an account can access this page as well.**

![Find a Playmate](images/readme/find_a_playmate.png) 


**After viewing the profile, the user can click on 'Contact Owner' to start chatting with the playdate's owner if she decides that the playmate is a right match for her dog.**

![Individual Dog](images/readme/individual_dog.png) 


**Upon clicking, the user will be brought to her chat page which allows her to initiate a conversation. If the conversation flows well, both owners can arrange for a playdate.**

![Chat](images/readme/chat.png) 

**Next, both owners just need to wait for the date to arrive, bring their dogs out and have some fun! ü•≥**


**However, if the user is not login to her account, there will be a pop up prompting the user to sign up or login in order to chat with other dog owners.**

![Popup](images/readme/pop_up.png) 


**At the 'Find a Place' page, there is a variety of categories recommended for the user to bring her dog to or to replenish dog supplies. There is also a map to help users to make informed decision of the distance required to reach the destination. Users who do not have an account can access this page as well.**

**Calculate Distance between the user's current location and planned destination**

![Calculate Distance](images/readme/calculate_distance.png) 

![Map](images/readme/map.png) 



**If the user scrolls down, she will be able to view the different categories. Upon clicking on 'SEE MORE', she will be directed to another page that displays all the recommended places by DogPals.**

![Categories](images/readme/categories_of_places.png) 


**Over here, the user can make use of the search and filter bar to look for a desired place to bring her dog to.**

![Find a Place Seemore](images/readme/find_a_place_seemore.png) 


**That's all! We hope you have a fuss free and enjoyable experience at DogPals! üê∂**
